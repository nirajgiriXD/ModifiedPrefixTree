# SizeIndependentSearchAlgorithm (SISA)

The program is written in C++.

The data structure I have used here is tree but instead of saving the words in nodes I have broken down each word into characters.
Each character is saved into a node in hierarchy. 
This approach is independent of the size of array / list from where the word is to be searched.
The time complexity is according to me is **_O(n)_** where n is the size of word to be searched.
This searching algorithm is an approach to beating the binary search and is still in progress.



Any kind of suggestion for the improvement of algorithm or program will be highly appreciated.
